# Absolute Average and Median Treatment Effects as Causal Estimands on Metric Spaces

This repo contains the source code for causal inference on metric spaces. 

For the detail, please refer to our paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03726](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03726).

## Description

- Data
  - It contains corpus callosum shape data.
  
## Code overview
We implement the proposed causal inference to investigate the causal relationship between Alzheimerâ€™s disease and the shape of the corpus callosum.
We also conduct simulation studies.
