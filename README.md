# Absolute Average and Median Treatment Effects as Causal Estimands on Metric Spaces

This repo contains the source code for causal inference on metric spaces. 


## Description

- Data
  - It contains corpus callosum shape data.
  
## Code overview
We implement the proposed causal inference to investigate the causal relationship between Alzheimerâ€™s disease and the shape of the corpus callosum.
We also conduct simulation studies.
